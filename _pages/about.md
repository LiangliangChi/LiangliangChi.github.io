I am Liangliang Chi, currently a Master's student at the College of Software Technology, Zhejiang University.I received my B.Eng. degree from the School of Future Technology (School of Artificial Intelligence) at Dalian University of Technology in 2025.My research interests primarily lie in the fields of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI Agents. I am particularly dedicated to exploring how LLMs can serve as the cognitive core for autonomous agents to solve complex, real-world problems.
